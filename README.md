# Homeschool Tracker
A java application written to demonstrate several Object Oriented Programming design patterns.

## Project Summary
Homeschooling multiple children with a provided curriculum can be straightforward, but there are a lot of tasks to keep 
track of. If a household has multiple children in different grades that move at different paces, keeping track of which 
lessons are planned for the day and which materials are need can quickly become overwhelming.

This application will manage a set of subjects and their lessons. Lessons will have their own materials and a flag for 
whether or not they have been completed.

Additionally, the application will manage students and which subjects each student has.
